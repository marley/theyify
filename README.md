# About
Way back in the golden days, the following sentence would have been considered gender neutral:

`Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for his entire life.`

Then, with the advent of women's rights, it has become fairly wide-spread to replace `he` with `he or she`.  However this could result in the following:

`Teach a person to fish, and you feed him or her for his or her entire life.`

Yikes.  Not only is this awkward-sounding, but it reinforces the ~ gender binary ~ :O

They-ify is a Chrome extension that addresses that addresses this dual issue by replacing any permutation of `he/she` with the appropriate form of `they`.

Using the previous example, They-ify would produce:

`Teach a person to fish, and you feed them for their entire life.` :)
